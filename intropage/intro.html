            <pre>                Hello! Welcome to my website! This was created under the guidance of 
         our lovely teacher, Mr. Hesby. Throughout the class, we learned about computer science, 
         and along the way, we made some of our own things. What you are reading right now
         is a prime exampe of this. As you can see, there is a nav bar that I have created below.
         Dpending on what you click, it takes you there. But before you click on any of them, I 
         would like to say that both of the generators were written before I knew the basics of
         code. That being said, please forgive the sloppiness of them. Other than that, enjoy!

            <pre id="about">                If you want specifics of what I learned, youcould just ask me... But because i'm 
         website now, and you haven't asked me yet, i'll preemptively answer that question for you;
         In the begining of the year, I was not actually a part of this class, but when I did get
         here, I learned that the rest of the class learned about tags and the rest of the week that 
         I got there, we specifically learned about the div tag. Because of the time that I missed, 
         I had no idea how to code, and was pretty much doing nothing all day. But look at me now,
         *awkward laughter*. But in all seriousness, I have vastly improved my coding skills from the
         start of the year. In the begining, I could barely make the doge generator on my own. So 
         I am pretty proud. But anyways, the next thing that we learned about was javascript, and 
         that was very confusing, but now, I've written my own bot, by myself. (see Vindinium page)
         I don't quite recall what we did next, but as I hinted at before, the thing after that was
         a Vindinium bot.
