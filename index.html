    <pre id="gitmean">                     Welcome to my website! If you are wondering why this is the first page, it's because Git Hub is mean... 
                Anyways, click anything from the nav bar to go there. If you can't find the nav bar, it's either because you are blind,
                or I somehow messed up the code. If you are blind, I am supprised that you've read this far... If you are wondering why
                I am just ranting about random things, it's because this page would look pretty bad if I don't have a lot of text, so 
                here it is. Because this is just filler, I would like to say that while I was coding this whole website together, I was
                jamming out to Tenacious D. Just a side-note, listening to them while you are coding makes you go so much faster. 
                UPDATE: I thought that Git Hub was just being a butt in regards of having an index.html page, but that was not the case.
                It turns out that it wasn't working because I didn't link my email... So that kind of sucks. I probably wouldn't have needed this page.
                UPDATE 2: I just went back to look at the final product, and I realized that I needed more filler. So this is it. If you, 
                for whatever reason want to keep reading, go ahead.. It'll probably be filler just like this though. So you decided to 
                stay? Okay, well today, because I finished my website, I made a poster for tonight. (That's right now, it's outside of the class)
                Okay, well that seems like a sufficient ammount of filler. So if you are reading this, stop. Go on, the filler is over.
